Classes and objects are the two core concepts in object-oriented programming.

A class defines what an object should look like, and an object is created based on that class.

Class	Objects
Fruit	Apple, Banana, Mango
Car	    Volvo, Audi, Toyota

Python Classes/Objects

Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
