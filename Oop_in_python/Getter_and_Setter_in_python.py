# Getter and Setter in Python

# In Python, a getter and setter are methods used to access and update the attributes of a class. 
# These methods provide a way to define controlled access to the attributes of an object, thereby ensuring the integrity of the data. 
# By default, attributes in Python can be accessed directly. However, this can pose problems when attributes need validation or 
# transformation before being assigned or retrieved.

# Getter: The getter method is used to retrieve the value of a private attribute. It allows controlled access to the attribute.
# Setter: The setter method is used to set or modify the value of a private attribute. It allows you to control how the value is 
# updated, enabling validation or modification of the data before it’s actually assigned.
