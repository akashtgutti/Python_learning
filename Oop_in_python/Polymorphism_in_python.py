# What is Polymorphism?
# The literal meaning of polymorphism is the condition of occurrence in different forms.
# Polymorphism is a very important concept in programming. It refers to the use of a single type entity
# (method, operator or object) to represent different types in different scenarios.

# Example 1: Polymorphism in addition operator
# We know that the + operator is used extensively in Python programs. But, it does not have a single usage.

# For integer data types, + operator is used to perform arithmetic addition operation.

num1 = 1
num2 = 2
print(num1+num2)
