########################## Data Analysis ##########################

# Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modelling data with the goal of discovering
# useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making.


########################## What is Pandas?  ##########################

# The name "pandas" has a reference to both "panel data", and "python data analysis" and was created by wes mckinney in 2008.
# Pandas is a python library used for working with data sets.
# It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.
# Read and write data structures and different formats : csv, text, XML,JSON,ZIP etc.


########################## Pandas Data Structures ##########################

# Three Data Structures:
# Series: One-Dimensional labeled arrays pd.Series(data)
# DataFrames: Two-Dimensional data structure with columns, much like a table.
# Panel : A panel is a 3D container of data.


########################## Importance of Pandas in Python ##########################

# Pandas allows us to analyze big data and make conclusions based on statistical theories.
# Pandas can clean messy data sets, and make them readable and relevant.
# Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN) in floating point as well as non-floating point data.

# Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects.
# > Data set merging and joining. Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets Provide series functionality.
